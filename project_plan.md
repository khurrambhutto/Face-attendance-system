# Facial recognition attendance system

### what we want (proposal)

we want a full system where the user (teacher/lecturer) will shoot a small  ~10 sec video of the class (including all present students) and it will be uploaded on a web application (responsive for mobiles). From here frames (having most students clearly) will be extracted and those frames will be given to the ML model which will recognize the student and out their name/id which then can be marked present on that day.
